# ToDo

The ToDo application developed using Flask and SQLite combines the power of a lightweight web framework with a reliable and efficient database system. With this application, users can seamlessly add, view, modify, and remove tasks from their to-do lists.

Flask, known for its simplicity and flexibility, provides the foundation for building web applications. It enables developers to create routes, handle requests and responses, and render dynamic templates. By leveraging Flask's intuitive syntax and extensive ecosystem, this ToDo application offers a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently.

SQLite, a self-contained and serverless database engine, adds persistence to the application. It allows seamless storage and retrieval of task data, ensuring that users' to-do lists remain intact across sessions. SQLite's lightweight nature makes it an ideal choice for small to medium-sized applications, providing excellent performance and ease of integration.

By combining Flask and SQLite, this ToDo application offers a straightforward yet powerful solution for organizing daily tasks, facilitating productivity, and ensuring that important activities are not overlooked. It serves as a practical demonstration of how web frameworks and databases can work together harmoniously to create functional and user-friendly applications.
